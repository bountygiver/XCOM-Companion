                <h3>How it works</h3>

                The research planner allows you to build a research queue and get a rough idea of how your research will progress. You can freely reorder the queue, though
                prerequisites are enforced (you won't be allowed to research Advanced Beam Lasers before Beam Lasers, for example).

                <br/><br/>

                Unlike in the actual game, you cannot switch away from a research while it is in progress.

                <br/><br/>

                <h3>Time estimates</h3>

                The time estimates are generated using the following:

                <ol>
                    <li>The facility plan you've established in the Facilities tab (i.e. number of Laboratories and lab adjacencies).</li>
                    <li>Interrogation bonuses earned before the research's position in the queue.</li>
                    <li>Country and continent bonuses earned before or during the research's position in the queue (e.g. We Have Ways or Expertise).</li>
                    <li>A rough guess at how many scientists you will have at that time.</li>
                </ol>

                The first 3 factors are all deterministic; if you follow the plan you've built exactly, those will always play out the same way. The fourth factor is much more random,
                because scientists are gained by completing council missions and fulfilling council requests, both of which are not only heavily randomized, but depend on your actions
                as well. (You also can gain scientists at each council report, which is deterministic and is factored in according to your satellite plan.)

                <br/><br/>

                To account for this, the number of scientists you will have is estimated based on data collected from other players' campaigns.
